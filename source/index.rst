TRIADS (Training in Research and Industry for the Advancement of Data Science framework)
=============================

Empowering the Next Generation of Data Scientists. TRIADS - Training in Research and Industry 
for the Advancement of Data Science - is a pioneering initiative aimed at developing a 
robust pipeline for nurturing industry-ready data scientists. Positioned at the intersection of 
academia and industry, our program is designed to equip students with the essential skills to drive 
innovation and excellence in the data science landscape of the United States

.. Using the material
.. ------------------

.. This is primarily a self-study course and reference material, which
.. you can browse at your own pace as it becomes relevant to you.  A
.. coordinated set of levels (~1 day) and modules (~ 1 hour) splits
.. skills into levels depending on your needs.  A course instructor or
.. research supervisor might point you at what is most important for your
.. current work.  Then, focus on those levels at your own pace.

.. Outline
.. -------

.. .. list-table::
..    :header-rows: 1

..    * * Level
..      * For who?
..      * Covers what?

..    * * **A:** Basics: What computing and how?
..      * Mini-level for everyone who's doing science with your computer
..        or may need to rely on computing resources later.
..      * What types of resources are available, when you'd use them, and
..        how to get help.  How to set up your computer to do scientific
..        work.  What comes next.

..    * * **B:** Related science skills
..      * Everyone publishing in a somewhat computational field.
..      * Making figures, papers, posters, and so on they way it's done
..        in computational fields.

..    * * **C:** Scientific computing (Linux and shell)
..      * Everyone who's doing more than pointing and clicking single
..        applications on your own computer or needs more computing power.
..      * In this level, you learn how to extend your power beyond your
..        own computer or existing applications.
..        Includes data management, scripting, Linux, and servers.  Linux
..        and the shell are a major point here: this is the defacto (and
..        only) good way to increase power.  Equal to the B level.

..    * * **D:** Clusters and high-performance computing
..      * Those who need more power than their own computer and need to
..        move to a cluster, whether or not it's highly parallelized.
..      * Computing on clusters and remote servers, more advanced Linux,
..        more scripting, batch systems, HPC data management.

..    * * **E:** Scientific coding
..      * When you start writing your own software to do your research.
..      * Version control, how to manage code, software, and data even
..        more.  We don't cover programming itself, just the untaught
..        parts about how to use it as a researcher.  Equal to the D level.

..    * * **F:** Advanced high performance computing
..      * Those who are programming the most demanding parallel
..        scientific applications.
..      * MPI (message passing interface, a parallel programming
..        framework), OpenMP (another one), GPU programming, etc.  And
..        anything more advanced.
